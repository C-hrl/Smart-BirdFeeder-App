# smart_bird_feeder

Companion App (works with our custom made bird feeder).
-Displays data related to bird interactions (bird species, time of visit, ...) with easy-to-use calendars and statistical graphs.
-Automatically records birds' "vocals" (chirps, whistles, ...) to enable "play back" on the app.
